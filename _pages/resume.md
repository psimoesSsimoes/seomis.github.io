**CEO @ Afectos a Si - Caparica, PT**

Hello, I'm Pedro Sim√µes, a dedicated hacker with a great team spirit, passionate about technology and how it shapes our world.

Always thinking about building and maintaining robust distributed systems. My expertise spans the full development lifecycle, from initial design and implementation to ongoing monitoring and the strategic planning of our technical roadmap.

I build software with honesty and openness at my core. No corporate speak‚Äîjust straightforward communication and genuine effort. When I commit to something, I pour myself into making it exceptional.

What truly energizes me is collaborating with talented, dedicated people tackling difficult problems together. I genuinely believe that when a group of individuals works hard while maintaining a positive, fun spirit, that combination is where innovation truly happens.

I'm always open to connecting with people who value craftsmanship and authenticity.

If you're looking for someone who transforms teams through dedication and technical excellence, don't hesitate to reach out.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Professional Experience

#### *Backend Team Leader* @[Easypay](https://www.easypay.pt/en)
**2021-11 ‚Äì Present**

We‚Äôve spent our time making a complex system more stable, more predictable, and easier to work with.

We implemented proper shutdown handling, enforced atomic operations where failure wasn‚Äôt an option, and built third-party integrations that could scale without drama.

We made observability a priority ‚Äî adding tests that mattered, metrics that told the truth, and error reporting that helped instead of overwhelmed. We added idempotency and request tracing to make our distributed flows traceable and trustworthy. We dug into access patterns, found what hurt performance or reliability, fixed what we could, and made thoughtful trade-offs when the perfect fix wasn‚Äôt worth the cost. We invested in each other ‚Äî through code reviews, mentoring, and honest technical conversations.

We shaped the way the team works: from practical processes to real feedback loops that actually improve things.

When the business came with fast-moving or fuzzy problems, we clarified, prioritized, and shipped solid solutions. Nothing flashy ‚Äî just steady, deliberate progress that made things better.

#### *Senior Software Engineer* @ [Worten](https://www.worten.pt/)
**2020-01 ‚Äì 2021-10**
Coordinated a team responsible for the implementation of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system at Worten. This critical system involved strategic planning, integration with existing systems, adherence to regulatory compliance, and management of user groups, roles and permissions. Managed various aspects of the IAM system, including authentication protocols, performance optimization, quality assurance, disaster recovery planning and budget management. My focus on collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement ensured a streamlined process that aligned with organizational goals and industry best practices.

This involved creating and implementing key components such as the Payment Gateway and Shopping Cart Rule System, both of which are live and fully operational in production today. My role focused on the implementation, continuous performance optimization, and real-time troubleshooting of these systems.

By ensuring they remain reliable, scalable, and efficient, me and my collegues played a key part in maintaining the smooth operation of the e-commerce platform, providing a seamless experience for millions of customers. It was a valuable experience, and I learned a great deal along the way!
