excerpt: üê¢ A quick guide to decoding pt-query-digest reports and fixing slow MySQL queries.
---

You've run `pt-query-digest` on your MySQL slow log. Now you‚Äôre staring at a huge wall of text and wondering what to do with it. Here's a practical breakdown of how to actually make sense of it ‚Äî and fix slow queries that are dragging your database down.

---

## 1. Start with the Summary

Right at the top, you‚Äôll see something like:

```
# 1620 total queries
# 161 unique query patterns
# Time range: April 17‚Äì30, 2025
# Exec time avg: 22s
# Rows examined avg: 5.34M
```

**What this tells you:**
- üíÄ 22 seconds average execution time is alarmingly high.
- üßê 5.34 million rows examined per query suggests indexing problems.

This section gives you a high-level health check of your workload. If it looks bad, it probably is.

---

## 2. Check the "Profile" Section

The profile ranks queries by their total response time contribution.

```
# Rank Query ID                            Response time   Calls R/Call   V
# ==== =================================== =============== ===== ======== =
#    1 0x3A250BE32D8B29F0                  12340.7 33.8%    381  32.3906  0.42
#    2 0x4B3D9E81C5C0BC7B                   4313.9 11.8%     11 392.1736  0.01
```

**How to read this:**
- üî¢ Rank: Based on total response time.
- üß† Query ID: A fingerprint of the query (use it to search further down).
- ‚è± Response Time: How long this query took in total (and % of the total).
- üîÅ Calls: How many times this query ran.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è R/Call: Average time per execution ‚Äî high values here are red flags.

## 3. Analyze Each Query Section

Scroll down for details on each top query. You‚Äôll see blocks like:

```
# Query 1: 381 QPS, 12.34ks total, 33.8% of all time...
# Rank: 1
# Time range: 2025-04-17 to 2025-04-30
#
# Attribute    pct   total     min     max     avg     95%  stddev  median
# ============ === ======= ======= ======= ======= ======= ======= =======
# Count          23     381
# Exec time      33 12341s      1s    160s     32s     70s     24s     28s
```

Look for:
- Execution time patterns ‚Äî are they spiky?
- High max or 95th percentile values? That‚Äôs trouble.
- Rows examined vs rows sent ‚Äî are we reading too much and returning too little?

Then you‚Äôll find:

```
# Tables
SHOW TABLE STATUS FROM `database` LIKE 'users'\G
SHOW CREATE TABLE `database`.`users`\G
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_login < '2025-01-01' AND status = 'inactive'\G
```

Check:
- Are there missing indexes?
- Are we scanning the whole table (`type: ALL`)?
- Is MySQL using a key (`key: NULL` means no index was used)?

---

## 4. Know the Red Flags üö©

Watch out for:

- ‚è≥ High average time per call with low execution count ‚Üí likely reporting/batch jobs.
- üîÅ High call counts with moderate execution time ‚Üí small optimizations can have huge payoff.
- üìä Rows examined >> Rows sent ‚Üí indexing issues.
- üîê High lock time ‚Üí contention problems.
- ‚ùó EXPLAIN mentions:
  - `Using filesort`
  - `Using temporary`
  - `type: ALL`
  - `key: NULL`
- üßÆ Functions on indexed columns: `DATE(created_at)`, `MONTH(...)`, etc.

---

## 5. Prioritize Wisely

Focus on the queries that:

- Take up >10% of total time
- Are called hundreds or thousands of times
- Examine huge numbers of rows unnecessarily
- Lock up tables or create contention

---

## 6. Fix Them üõ†

Once you‚Äôve picked your top offenders:

- ‚úÖ Add or adjust indexes (on WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY columns)
- üîÑ Rewrite queries for better execution plans
- üí° Avoid functions in WHERE clauses that disable indexes
- üßä Cache results when appropriate
- üîç Use `EXPLAIN` to check what MySQL is doing behind the scenes

---

## Bonus: Use Grep to Automate the Hunt

```bash
# Profile section
grep -A 10 "# Profile" slow-queries.txt

# High row scan, low return
grep -A 20 "Rows examine.*M" slow-queries.txt

# Filesorts or temp tables
grep -A 10 "Using temporary" slow-queries.txt
grep -A 10 "Using filesort" slow-queries.txt

# Full table scans
grep -A 10 "type: ALL" slow-queries.txt
grep -A 10 "key: NULL" slow-queries.txt

# Lock time issues
grep -A 5 "Lock time.*[0-9]s" slow-queries.txt
```

---

## TL;DR üß†

- üîç Start with the Profile section
- üö® Look for high response time or bad EXPLAIN signs
- ‚öôÔ∏è Focus on top 5‚Äì10 offenders
- üîß Fix indexes, rewrite bad queries, reduce rows examined
- Slow queries are normal. Staying blind to them isn‚Äôt. Learn the patterns, spot the pain points, and chip away at them. Your database ‚Äî and your users ‚Äî will notice.
> **Note:** While tools like `pt-query-digest` provide powerful insights, nothing replaces understanding the **context** in which these queries run. Sometimes, there are valid tradeoffs that justify a "slow" query, or cases where taking action could cause more disruption than leaving things as they are‚Äî*at least for the time being*. Use the data to inform your decisions, **but don't skip the thinking part**.
