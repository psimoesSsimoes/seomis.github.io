Correlating logs on kibana is usually pretty easy. If you use an request-id header with some unique value,  given some request on system x, you can search the log from the caller, system y.
Another common form would be using a correlation ID or use information as the ip address.

But sometimes you have systems interacting that have no good log correlation. Sure you can reach a consensus indexing

 Every developer needs a fast way to search for a current word in multiple files.
