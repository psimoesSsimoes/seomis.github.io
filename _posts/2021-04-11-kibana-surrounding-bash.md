## Correlating log data on Kibana is quite easy.

Usually if you use the request-id header given some request on system x, you can search the log from the caller, system y.

But sometimes you have systems interacting that have no good log correlation. Sure you can reach a consensus indexing

 Every developer needs a fast way to search for a current word in multiple files.
