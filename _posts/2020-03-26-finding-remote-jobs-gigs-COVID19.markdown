With stay-at-home orders increasing across the US and many people out of work or feeling insecure about their jobs, there is an urgent need to find work that can be done completely online. This is true for people who are used to working remotely and those who have never worked remotely or done any kind of digital work.

I’ve been working remotely since 2015 and I am currently writing a book on The New Distributed Workforce, where I discuss opportunities for women to build flexible, remote careers. A big part of this is exploring what kinds of jobs can be done remotely and where people can find legitimate remote jobs and freelance work.

Due to COVID19, a lot of digital jobs that were previously done in-office will be performed remotely for the foreseeable future. If your priority is simply securing a paycheck during this time, apply to **everything** relevant that can be done from home for now, understanding your remote life might only be temporary until the world starts transitioning back to the office.

However, this list focuses on where you can find remote *specific* jobs — pandemic or no!

### Standing Out

* Keep your resume to one page (if possible), making sure that it’s achievement-oriented. Use concise bullet points and keywords. If you need a free resume template, I like [NovoResume](https://novoresume.com/resume-templates){:target="_blank"}.

* Create a short but powerful personal mission statement that really demonstrates who you are and what drives you.

* Create a few different versions of your resume, tailored to each specific type of job you’re applying to.

* Keep cover letters short but specific to the job and company you’re applying to. Show that you’re familiar with their mission and that it resonates with you. Talk about why you’re uniquely qualified and what you can bring to the table to help them grow.

* Include any links to your portfolio, blog, or personal case studies, which can further add to your credibility as a candidate. If you don’t have these things, quarantine can be a great time to start putting them together.

* If you’ve never had a digital job before, consider personal projects and other things you’ve worked on or contributed to that demonstrate digital skillsets, like managing a Facebook community. Express familiarity with tools like Google Drive, Slack, Zoom, and others that the company may be using. Also consider what parts of your work experience can easily translate to the digital world, like customer service.

### Standing Out

If you’re looking for additional streams of income, freelance work can be a great solution! Before you start applying, I recommend putting together a **portfolio** of relevant work to share with potential clients. Platforms like UpWork allow you to upload work samples directly to your profile, but you can also create a basic portfolio site using [Wordpress](https://themeisle.com/blog/portfolio-site-on-wordpress/){:target="_blank"} or [PortfolioBox](https://www.portfoliobox.net/){:target="_blank"}.

Freelance jobs can be highly competitive, and every bit of effort to stand out can make a difference. If you don’t have any work samples, now is the time to create them, whether it’s for fun projects or helping a friend’s business.

## Avoiding Remote Job Scams

With the increased demand for remote work, job seekers have also been noticing an increase in “work from home” job scams. My basic rules of thumb are: 1) If something sounds too good to be true, it usually is, and 2) Any “job” asking you to spend money upfront, for any reason, is a scam.

Skillcrush has a great guide to identifying remote job scams, which you can read [here](https://skillcrush.com/blog/how-to-tell-if-a-remote-job-is-legit/){:target="_blank"}.
